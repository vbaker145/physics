    "**My** interest in the topic stems from the new generation of astronomical sky surveys like the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/), of which Drexel is a member institution.  While the Big Data examples above are impressive, in many ways, projects like LSST *define* Big Data.  \n",

In particle physics, they throw away *most* of the data because there is so much.  Instead they have the notion of a *trigger*, which is basically as series of \"if-then\" statements that decide whether or not an \"event\" is worth saving (for future analsyis) or not."
