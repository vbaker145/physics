# PHYS_T480

This is the repository for PHYS T480/580 "Big Data Physics: Methods of Machine Learning" at Drexel University, taught by Prof. Gordon Richards.  The course syllabus can be found at http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~gtr/teaching/physT480/

The course is a series of jupyter notebooks, where I have drawn heavily from resources from the following people/places:

Jake Vanderplas (University of Washington) -- one of the primary code developers of scikit-learn and astroML.  I draw a lot from https://github.com/jakevdp/ESAC-stats-2014, but you can find a lot more from him too: https://github.com/jakevdp/.

Zeljko Ivezic (University of Washington) -- the lead author of the textbook that we use (http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html)

Andy Connolly (University of Washington), particularly http://cadence.lsst.org/introAstroML/

Karen Leighly (University of Oklahoma), particularly http://http://seminar.ouml.org/

Adam Miller (Northwestern University), particularly https://github.com/LSSTC-DSFP/LSSTC-DSFP-Sessions/

Jo Bovy (University of Toronto), particularly http://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/teaching.html

My thanks also to Maher Harb (Drexel University) and Kevin Footer (Deloitte).

I have tried to be careful about properly attributing anything drawn from these resources, but if it isn't clear where something comes from, it is probably there.
Others are welcome to draw from here for their own Machine Learning courses.  Please send any corrections to gtr@physics.drexel.edu.
