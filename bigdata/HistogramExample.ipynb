(As a side note, KDE is the core of the quasar classification work that I do, which is how I got into this machine learning business in the first place.  Way before it was popular I might add!)  In short the idea here is to represent each data point not as a delta function, but rather as a distribution (e.g., a Gaussian).  Then those distributions (\"kernels\") are summed up to produce the PDF.  One of the advantages of this is that it combines the best of 1) the histgram and 2) the rug plot: where 1) tells us the relative height of the distribution and 2) centers the data points at the actual location of the data instead of within some arbitrary bin.\n",

The Epanechnikov kernel has truncated wings.  \n",

Specifically, what is the optimal width such that objects with a known classification are indeed given that classification by our machine learning algorithm.  But that is the topic for another day.  For now, we'll just play with the widths by hand to see what might work best.  N.B. the widths of the kernel distribution are referred to as \"bandwidth\"."
