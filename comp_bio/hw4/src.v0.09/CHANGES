version:

0.09:
		- added polymer option. Polymers are strings of LJ particles
		  joined by "bonds" enforced in the verlet_polymers integrator
		  function.
		- added calculation of end-to-end distance and radius of gyration
		  for the polymers.
		- added quasi 3D representation graphics, with filled atoms. Available
		  through defs.h
		- added compile option in gl_obj.cc to color verlet lists around
		  one particle
		- added option to read/write particle positions. Now, can save a collapsed
		  coil polymer and read into another simulation with smaller energy.
		- the input parameters will be written right after hitting the "apply" button
		  from the parameters window. This input is compatible with the readable
		  input.txt file.
		- made confined simulations work with a define statement #if CONFINED == 0
		- fixed update of verlet lists to be 1/2 of the rc-rl distance.
		- verlet list cutoff is not available from the params window.
		- FIXED MAJOR BUG IN VERLET LISTS CODE. NOW IT CONSERVES ENERGY.
		- added measuring real time per simu seconds for benchmarking.
0.08:
		- added option for putting only two particles. Used
		  to illustrate concepts of integrating algorithms
0.07:
		- Fixed some bugs in the graphical frontend
		- Corrected current terminology from Ising to XY model.
		- Added Legendre 2nd order poly to energy possibilities.
		  Call it the 'LL' model.
		- Added NPT for regular MC
0.06:
		- Added Metropolis Monte Carlo method. It can
		  adjust the MC step dynamically.
0.05:
		- Graphics take modifications on read parameters
		- Added algorithm for doing hard spheres on event drivent
		  dynamics.
		- Added Gaussian with input mu and sigma
		- Added Langevin dynamics object
		- Fixed velocity verlet to be more efficient by calculating
		  forces only once
		- Graphical program can tag a particle and write tagged
		  trajectory to file
		- Added rudimentary temperature re-scale button. Only
		  works with velocity verlet.
0.04:
		- Added force calculation with distance cutoff rc.
		- Added verlet lists
		- Added graphics with fltk
0.03:
	1/24/10:
		- Added a diffusion function where the mean square
		  displacement and vacf are calculated
		- All results are now dumped into the 'results'
		  directory
		- Added g(r) calculation
0.02:
	1/17/10:
		- Added a function for random numbers drawn from
		  a Gaussian distribution in base/ran01.cc
	1/18/10:
		- Added output_velocities to ensemble.cc
		- Added instantaneous pressure calculation via
		  calculation of the virial in forces.cc
	1/20/10:
		- Addition of a steepest descent function
		  with arbitrary size step
		- Split the sys.init() function into two separate
		  to allow for positions and velocities to
		  happen at different times
	1/22/10:
		- Inclusion of velocity verlet integration 
		- Most outputs are redirectied to files.
0.01:
	1/14/10: 
		- First version of the program.
