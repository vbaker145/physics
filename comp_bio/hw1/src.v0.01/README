Code to accompany the PHYS 462/562 Computational Biophysics course.

The code is written in C++ and uses the object oriented programming
model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
To RUN:
	% make
	% ./run_me input_v01.txt


-------------------------------------------------------------------
In this directory there should be:

 main.cc	- Main part of the program. It sets up the
 			simulation, reads input file, initializes, and runs the
			simulation.

 input_v0.xx.txt			- text file containing the input parameters
 			to run the simulation. This one gets read by ensemble.cc

 ensemble.cc, ensemble.h	- 'ensemble' object. This contains an array 
 			of 'atom's, physical properties of the system, and other
			variables

 atom.cc, atom.h 			- 'atom' object 

 forces.cc, forces.h		- 'force' object. This contains functions to
 			implement LJ forces, and others

 integrator.cc, integrator.h	- 'integrator' object. This object knows
 			how to implement different algorithms for the Finite Difference
			Methods presented in class.

 defs.h						- contains various definitions
 base						- directory that contains some base objects
 makefile					- makefile to automatize compilation commands
 objects					- directory to hold the compiled files
 tests						- directory to hold results from tests
